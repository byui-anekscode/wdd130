        <p>Hello! My name is Chinyere Anekeje and I am from Nigeria, West Africa. I enjoy reading, watching movies and cooking.
            As an ICT teacher, I'm passionate about empowering students to embrace technology and think critically about digital solutions. 
            By connecting my interests with my teaching, I am able to make lessons more engaging, showing students that learning tech skills is not just about theory, it's a pathway to innovation and self-expression. </p>
